# Email Notification System Setup Guide

WorldLeader.io now has a complete email notification system powered by **Resend**. This guide will help you configure it for production use.

---

## Overview

The email system sends professional, branded emails for:
- **Welcome Emails** - When users register
- **Password Reset** - When users request password resets
- **Overtaken Notifications** - When someone climbs past a user on the leaderboard
- **Milestone Achievements** - When users reach Top 10, Top 5, Top 3, or #1 (ready for future use)

---

## Setup Steps

### 1. Create a Resend Account

1. Go to [resend.com](https://resend.com) and sign up for a free account
2. You get **3,000 emails per month free** - perfect for getting started
3. Verify your email address

### 2. Get Your API Key

1. Log into your Resend dashboard
2. Navigate to **API Keys** section
3. Click **Create API Key**
4. Give it a name like "WorldLeader Production"
5. Copy the API key (starts with `re_...`)

### 3. Configure Environment Variables

Add the following to your `.env` file:

```env
# Email Configuration
RESEND_API_KEY="re_your_actual_key_here"
EMAIL_FROM="WorldLeader.io <onboarding@resend.dev>"
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL="https://world-leader.vercel.app"
```

**For Vercel:**
1. Go to your project settings in Vercel
2. Navigate to **Environment Variables**
3. Add:
   - `RESEND_API_KEY` with your Resend API key
   - `EMAIL_FROM` with `WorldLeader.io <onboarding@resend.dev>`
   - Ensure `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` is set to your production URL

### 4. Using Resend's Default Domain (Quick Start)

For testing and initial launch, you can use Resend's default sending domain:
- **From address**: `onboarding@resend.dev`
- No DNS configuration needed
- Emails work immediately
- Perfect for development and MVP launch

**Note**: Emails sent from `resend.dev` may have slightly lower deliverability than a custom domain, but it's excellent for getting started quickly.

### 5. Setting Up a Custom Domain (Recommended for Production)

For better branding and deliverability, set up your own domain:

#### Step 1: Add Domain to Resend
1. In Resend dashboard, go to **Domains**
2. Click **Add Domain**
3. Enter your domain (e.g., `worldleader.io`)

#### Step 2: Configure DNS Records
Resend will provide DNS records to add to your domain. You need to add:
- **SPF Record** (TXT)
- **DKIM Record** (TXT)
- **DMARC Record** (TXT)
- **MX Record** (optional, for tracking bounces)

Example DNS records (yours will be different):
```
Type: TXT
Name: @
Value: v=spf1 include:resend.com ~all

Type: TXT
Name: resend._domainkey
Value: [Resend will provide this]

Type: TXT
Name: _dmarc
Value: v=DMARC1; p=none; rua=mailto:dmarc@worldleader.io
```

#### Step 3: Verify Domain
1. Wait 24-48 hours for DNS propagation
2. In Resend dashboard, click **Verify Domain**
3. Once verified, update your environment variable:

```env
EMAIL_FROM="WorldLeader.io <noreply@worldleader.io>"
```

## Email Deliverability Best Practices

### 1. Warm Up Your Domain
If using a custom domain:
- Start with low volume (10-20 emails/day)
- Gradually increase over 2-3 weeks
- This builds sender reputation

### 2. Monitor Bounce Rates
- Keep bounce rate under 5%
- Remove invalid email addresses
- Use double opt-in for signups (optional)

### 3. Engagement
- High open rates improve deliverability
- Compelling subject lines
- Personalized content

### 4. Avoid Spam Triggers
- Don't use ALL CAPS in subject lines
- Avoid excessive exclamation marks!!!!
- Include unsubscribe link (for marketing emails)
- Our transactional emails are exempt from CAN-SPAM

---

## Troubleshooting

### Emails Not Sending

**Check 1: API Key**
```bash
# Verify environment variable is set
echo $RESEND_API_KEY
```

**Check 2: Resend Dashboard**
- Check "Emails" tab for error messages
- Look for "Failed" status

**Check 3: Server Logs**
- Development: Check terminal for email logs
- Production: Check Vercel logs for errors

**Common Errors:**
- `401 Unauthorized` - Invalid API key
- `403 Forbidden` - Domain not verified (if using custom domain)
- `422 Validation Error` - Invalid email address format

### Emails Going to Spam

**Solutions:**
1. Set up custom domain with proper DNS records
2. Enable DMARC reporting
3. Avoid spam trigger words
4. Include physical address in footer (for marketing emails)
5. Authenticate your domain (SPF, DKIM, DMARC)

### Rate Limiting

Resend free tier limits:
- **3,000 emails/month**
- **100 emails/day** per sending domain

If you exceed limits:
- Upgrade to paid plan ($20/month for 50,000 emails)
- Or implement email queuing to spread sends over time
