# üö® Security Incident Response - Database Credentials Exposed

**Status**: Database credentials were exposed in commit 65ef610
**File**: DATABASE_CONNECTED.md
**Detection**: GitGuardian alert on October 27, 2025

---

## ‚úÖ IMMEDIATE ACTIONS (Do These NOW)

### 1. Reset Neon Database Password (CRITICAL - Do First!)

1. Go to https://console.neon.tech
2. Click on your **WorldLeader** project
3. Navigate to **Settings** or **Dashboard**
4. Click **Reset password** or **Create new role**
5. **Copy the new connection string** - you'll need it!

Example new format:
```
postgresql://neondb_owner:NEW_PASSWORD@ep-square-recipe-a7wm946p-pooler.ap-southeast-2.aws.neon.tech/neondb?sslmode=require&channel_binding=require
```

### 2. Update Local .env File

Replace your DATABASE_URL in `.env` with the new connection string:

```bash
# Old (COMPROMISED - DO NOT USE)
# DATABASE_URL="postgresql://neondb_owner:npg_uXyc9m1sEvRY@..."

# New (from Neon dashboard)
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://neondb_owner:NEW_PASSWORD@ep-square-recipe-a7wm946p-pooler.ap-southeast-2.aws.neon.tech/neondb?sslmode=require&channel_binding=require"
```

### 3. Update Vercel Environment Variables

1. Go to https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Select your **WorldLeader** project
3. Go to **Settings** ‚Üí **Environment Variables**
4. Find `DATABASE_URL`
5. Click **Edit** and replace with new connection string
6. Click **Save**
7. **Redeploy** your application

### 4. Test New Connection Locally

```bash
# Test the new connection
npx prisma db pull

# If successful, restart dev server
npm run dev
```

---

## üîß CLEANUP ACTIONS (After Rotating Password)

### 5. Remove Credentials from Git History

The credentials are in commit `65ef610` in file `DATABASE_CONNECTED.md`.

**Option A: Remove from git history (RECOMMENDED)**

```bash
# Install BFG Repo-Cleaner
brew install bfg  # Mac
# or download from: https://rtyley.github.io/bfg-repo-cleaner/

# Replace the exposed credential in all commits
echo "npg_uXyc9m1sEvRY" > passwords.txt
bfg --replace-text passwords.txt

# Clean up
git reflog expire --expire=now --all
git gc --prune=now --aggressive

# Force push (requires force since we're rewriting history)
git push origin main --force
```

**Option B: Revert and recommit (SIMPLER)**

```bash
# The credentials are already removed from the file
# Just commit the fix
git add DATABASE_CONNECTED.md
git commit -m "security: Remove exposed database credentials from documentation"
git push origin main
```

**Note**: Option B is simpler but leaves the credentials in git history. Since you've already rotated the password, the old credentials are useless anyway. Option A removes them from history entirely.

### 6. Add Additional .gitignore Rules

Make sure these are in `.gitignore`:

```
# Environment variables
.env
.env.local
.env.*.local
.env.production

# Database files
*.db
*.db-journal
prisma/*.db
prisma/*.db-journal

# Documentation with credentials (if needed)
**/CREDENTIALS.md
```

## üìã VERIFICATION CHECKLIST

After completing the above steps:

- [ ] New database password generated in Neon
- [ ] Local `.env` updated with new credentials
- [ ] Local database connection tested (npx prisma db pull works)
- [ ] Vercel environment variable updated
- [ ] Vercel redeployed with new credentials
- [ ] Production site tested (can register/login)
- [ ] DATABASE_CONNECTED.md cleaned (no credentials)
- [ ] Changes committed and pushed
- [ ] Old credentials confirmed non-functional

---

## üõ°Ô∏è PREVENTION MEASURES (To Avoid Future Incidents)

### 1. Never Include Real Credentials in Documentation

**Bad:**
```markdown
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:password123@host/db"
```

**Good:**
```markdown
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://USERNAME:PASSWORD@HOST/DATABASE?sslmode=require"
# Or use placeholders:
DATABASE_URL="<your-database-connection-string>"
```

### 2. Use Environment Variable Examples

Create `.env.example` with placeholders:
```bash
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:password@host:5432/database"
JWT_SECRET="your-secret-here-minimum-32-characters"
```

### 3. Pre-commit Hooks (Optional)

Install git-secrets to prevent credential commits:
```bash
brew install git-secrets
git secrets --install
git secrets --register-aws
```

### 4. Regular Security Scans

- Enable GitGuardian (already active - caught this!)
- Use GitHub's secret scanning
- Run `npm audit` regularly

---

## üìä IMPACT ASSESSMENT

### What Was Exposed?
- PostgreSQL connection string
- Database hostname
- Database username
- Database password
- Database name

### What Could Someone Do With This?
- ‚ùå Read all user data (emails, usernames, hashed passwords)
- ‚ùå Modify or delete data
- ‚ùå Create fake users
- ‚ùå Access transaction records
- ‚úÖ Good news: Passwords are hashed with bcrypt (not plaintext)
- ‚úÖ Good news: No payment data stored (just amounts)

### Timeframe
- Exposed: October 27, 2025 05:41:54 UTC
- Detected: October 27, 2025 (same day - good!)
- Window: < 1 hour (very good!)

### Likelihood of Exploitation
- **LOW** - Detected quickly by GitGuardian
- **LOW** - Short exposure window
- **MEDIUM** - Public GitHub repository
- **Action**: Rotate password immediately to eliminate risk

## üîê ADDITIONAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

### 1. Enable IP Allowlisting (Optional but Recommended)

In Neon dashboard:
1. Go to your project settings
2. Enable **IP Allowlist**
3. Add your server IPs (Vercel provides these)
4. This restricts database access to only your servers

### 2. Use Connection Pooling

Already configured with `-pooler` endpoint - good!

### 3. Monitor Database Activity

In Neon dashboard:
- Check **Monitoring** tab
- Look for unusual connection patterns
- Review query logs if available

### 4. Rotate JWT Secret Too (Extra Paranoid)

While not exposed, for extra security:
```bash
# Generate new JWT secret
openssl rand -base64 32

# Update in .env and Vercel
```

### 5. Consider Database Backups

In Neon dashboard:
- Enable automated backups
- Test restore procedure
- Keep recent backup before rotating password

### If You Need Help
1. Check Neon dashboard for connection issues
2. Verify `.env` file has correct credentials
3. Test with `npx prisma db pull`
4. Check Vercel logs for deployment errors

---

## ‚úÖ RESOLUTION

Once all steps are complete:

1. Verify old credentials don't work (try connecting with old password)
2. Verify new credentials work locally
3. Verify new credentials work in production (Vercel)
4. Mark GitGuardian alert as resolved
5. Document lessons learned

**The incident is resolved when:**
- [ ] Old credentials are rotated (unusable)
- [ ] New credentials are secure (not in git)
- [ ] Application works with new credentials
- [ ] Team is aware of best practices

---

**Remember**: This is a learning opportunity. Credential leaks happen, even to experienced developers. The important thing is:
1. Detect quickly ‚úÖ (GitGuardian caught it immediately)
2. Respond quickly ‚úÖ (Rotating password now)
3. Prevent future incidents ‚úÖ (Better documentation practices)

You're doing great by acting on this immediately! üöÄ
